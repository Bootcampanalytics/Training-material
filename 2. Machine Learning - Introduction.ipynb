            "source": "Here is a list of things to take in great consideration while developing ML systems:\n\n1. **No Free Lunch:** A wide variety of techniques exist for modeling. An important theorem in statistical machine learning essentially states that no one technique will outperform all other techniques on all problems *(Wolpert & MacReady, 1997)*. This theorem is sometimes referred to as *No Free Lunch*. Often, a modeling group will specialize in one particular technique, and will tout that technique as the being intrinsically superior to others. Such a claim should be regarded with extreme suspicion. Furthermore, the field of statistical machine learning is evolving rapidly, and new algorithms are developed at a regular pace, this determines a very fast aging for ML approaches. This is the reason why in Addfor we rely on Open Source, Lean and Data-Driven Development and **Combinatorial Innovation**.\n\n2. **Beware of False Predictors:** In selecting input variables for a model, one must be careful not to include false predictors. A false predictor is a variable that is strongly correlated with the output class, but that is not available in a realistic prediction scenario. This step is stricktly data-dependent and can be accomplished by paying attention to the choice of the validation dataset. **Correlation does not imply causation:** ice-cream sales is a strong predictor for drowning deaths.\n\n3. **Mind Data Balancing:** Always check if your algorithm is suitable to handle Data Asymmetricity.\n\n4. **Correctly Define Output Classes:**  If the model's task is to predict a system failure, it seems natural for the output classes to be \"fail\" and \"not fail\". However, characterizing the exact conditions under which failure occurs is not straightforward. For example two failures for different reasons could represent very different classes.\n\n5. **Data Preparation:** this is maybe the most important task in any predictive algorithm, we dedicate a whole notebook to it! \n\n6. **Model Selection:** Any modeling technique can be used to construct of a continuum of models, from simple to complex. One of the key issues in modeling is model selection, which involves picking the appropriate level of complexity for a model given a data set. Although model selection methods can be automated to some degree, model selection cannot be avoided. If someone claims otherwise, or does not emphasize their expertise in model selection, one should be suspicious of his abilities.\n\n7. **Segmentation:** Often, a data set can be broken into several smaller, more homogenous data sets, which is referred to as segmentation. For example, a customer data base might be split into business and residential customers. Although domain experts can readily propose segmentations, enforcing a segmentation suggested by domain experts is generally not the most prudent approach to modeling, because the data itself provides clues to how the segmentation should be performed. Consequently, one should be concerned if a modeler claims to utilize a priori segmentation.\n\n8. **Model Evaluation:** Once a model has been built, the natural question to ask is how accurate it is. Here we describe common sorts of deception that can occur in assessing and evaluating a model:\n\n    a) *Failing to use an independent test set:* To obtain a fair estimate of performance, the model must be evaluated on examples that were not contained in the training set. The available data must be split into nonoverlapping subsets, with the test set reserved only for evaluation.\n\n    b) *Assuming stationarity of the test environment:* For many difficult problems, a model built based on historical data will become a poorer and poorer predictor as time goes on, because the environment is nonstationary--the rules and behaviors of individuals change over time. Consequently, the best measure of a model's true performance will be obtained if it is tested on data from a different point in time relative to the training data.\n\n    c) *Incomplete reports of results:* An accurate model will correctly discriminate examples of one output class from examples of another output class. Discrimination performance is best reported with an ROC curve, a lift curve, or a precision-recall curve. Any report of accuracy using only a single number is suspect.\n\n    d) *Filtering data to bias results:* In a large data set, one segment of the population may be easier to predict than another. If a model is trained and tested just on this segment of the population, it will be more accurate than a model that must handle the entire population. Selective filtering can turn a hard problem into an easier problem.\n\n    e) *Selective sampling of test cases:* A fair evaluation of a model will utilize a test set that is drawn from the same population as the model will eventually encounter in actual usage.\n\n    f) *Failing to assess statistical reliability:* When comparing the accuracy of two models, it is not sufficient to report that one model performed better than the other, because the difference might not be statistically reliable. \"Statistical reliability\" means, among other things, that if the comparison were repeated using a different sample of the population, the same result would be achieved.",
